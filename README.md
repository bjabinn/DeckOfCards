## About The Project
This project tries to representen a deck of a poker-style playing cards (52 cards): 4 suits and with
faces of Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen and King.

It has to provide two operations:

* shuffle(): returnos no value, but result in the cards in the deck being randomly permuted.

* dealOneCard(): this method returns one card of the deck.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* JDK 8 (It has been also tested in JAVA 11)
* Maven 3

### Installation
```
$ mvn clean jacoco:prepare-agent test verify
```
This will generate the .jar file and run the coverage report
## Generate site files
```
$ mvn clean jacoco:prepare-agent site
```


## Reporting
On /doc/site/index.html we will be able to find the:
* Quality metrics
* Unit test coverage
* Javadoc documentation

## Decision
* Language: It have been implemented using:
<ul>
    <li><em>JAVA 8</em>: to use lambdas and streams. For 2 reason: it is the most used languages used at Appian, it is wide language and supported one
    and because it is my main programming language. I could have done it using C#, Python or NodeJS as well.</li>
    <li><em>Maven</em>: to manage the dependencies.</li>
    <li><em>Jacoco and surfire</em>: to get the test coverage.</li>
</ul>

## Next steps
* API: this functional operations might be exposed as a microservices.

* Load test: just for testing purpose, besides the unit tests another kind of test might be implemented using artillery, k6 or similar.

* CI / CD: this code might be included inside a continuos integration workflow. For example: build and update after a pull/merge request has been done.
